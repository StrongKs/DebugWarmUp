# DebugWarmUp  

## Overview  
Welcome to **DebugWarmUp**! This repository contains a simple debugging exercise designed to help you practice identifying and fixing errors using a debugger.  

## Goals (Steps)
1. Clone the repository and set up a local development environment.  
2. Create a new branch for your solution.  
3. Identify and fix the given issue in the C++ program.  
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful message.  
5. Push your solution to the repository under your own branch.  

## Guidelines  
- Your branch name should follow the format: **yourname-solution**.  
- Ensure your solution includes comments explaining the fix.  
- Follow best practices for Git commits (e.g., clear messages, meaningful changes).  
- Do not modify files unrelated to your solution.  
- If submitting via Pull Request, provide a brief explanation of your approach.  

## Notes  
- Use a debugger to step through the program and identify the issue.  
- This is a learning exerciseâ€”focus on understanding **why** the error occurs and how debugging tools help.  
- If you have questions, reach out via the repository's Issues tab.  

Happy debugging! ðŸš€
